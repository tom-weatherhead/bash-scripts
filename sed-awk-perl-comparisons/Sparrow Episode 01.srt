00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,600
<i>1941 Winter, Shanghai had already fallen into enemy hands.</i>

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,800
<i>From the outside, it still looked extravagant and well off.</i>

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
<i>But under the peaceful exterior,</i>

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>the Japanese special forces had already taken control of the entire Reorganized National Government's Special Operations Division,</i>

8

<i>wildly arresting and killing anti-Japanese rebels.</i>

<i>The leaders, the anti-Japanese Chinese military men, of our political party</i>

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,600
<i>At the same time, intelligence agents were sent out to infiltrate the enemy's heart,</i>

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>starting the underground fight.</i>

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,500
<i>Both forces gambled with life and death.</i>

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,400
<i>Everywhere there was danger. Every step with the intention to kill.</i>

15
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,350
<i>At Shanghai Bund, the war for spy information</i>

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,500
<i>magnificently opened its prologue.</i>

17

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,500
Your earrings are so pretty, Li Li.

33
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,300
You just chose well!

34
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,800
Cathy, your hair is an inch longer. If you cut it, it'd look perfect.

35
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
I was just waiting for you to come and cut it for me!

36
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Later, we'll be opening a function room upstairs waiting for you.

Okay!

I will definitely come!

We'll be leaving first!

41

You don't really think you're popular, do you?

42
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
What they like is the money I carry.

43
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,100
Can they find a second fool that would let them spend money like this?

44
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,000
You should only treat one woman well.

45
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,900
We'll talk when I find her.

46

You're right.

What difference is there between the world and the underworld now?

56

You want to die and be reborn quickly.

But have you thought about your wife and son?

58

I just hope that you can think it through clearly.

59

Miss, just give me some respect.

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,400
Vodka is too strong. It doesn't suit a lady like you.

Tom, give her one bottle of Kvass.

Okay, Mr. Chen.

83
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,900
- Will you also drink Kvass?<br>- Right.

84
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Thank you.

85
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,400
It looks like you are a player who likes parties.

86
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I don't like to drink. I only drink this type.

87
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm not a player either.

88
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,800
Maybe I'm getting old. I don't even have the energy to play around.

89
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,400
Then why are you still smoking

90
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,500
the Japanese's Sakura cigarettes?

91
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Because this matches my identity as a Chinese traitor.

92
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,900
Chief, he signed it.

93
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,500
Chief, this Sparrow!

94
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,000
This Sparrow finally landed in our net.

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,100
The Heavens are really rewarding us food to eat.

96
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,900
- Call Chen Shen back for me.<br>- Yes, sir.

97
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm Prime Minister.

98
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I didn't think that it'd be you...

99
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Sister-in-Law.

100
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,600
Chen Shen, you've suffered.

101
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm not suffering.

102
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,500
After my brother sacrificed himself,

103
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,900
I've been looking all over for you.

104
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,300
I've been looking for Pi Pi.

105
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm alone in Shanghai.

106
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,300
I'm like a wandering ghost.

107
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,600
I know.

108
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Division Chief, Special Operations Team 1 has completed our preparations. We are ready for your orders.

109
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Where is your team leader?

110
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,000
Our leader...

111
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
We didn't find him. Did he take a day off?

112
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,100
Who did he take leave with? Why don't I know about it?

113
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,400
I can't ever stop worrying about him.

114
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,400
Good sign. Set out to Mee Koo May.

115
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,600
Listen to my order!

116
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,400
Everyone, turn left!

117
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,700
Run forward!

118
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,000
Get into the car.

119
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,500
In these three years, where did you two go?

120
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Shen Hai told me to tell you one thing:

121
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,900
Silence is for one to have a better chance to explode.

122
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,500
You didn't receive any contact for these three years so you could hide deeper,

123
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,700
but the organization has always been concerned about you.

124
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
Three years.

125
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,300
What did I do for these three years? I only waited every day.

126
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,900
I spent my time around red party lights, green wines, food, and playing!

127
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,600
Like a walking corpse.

128
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
I know.

129
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,100
It's been difficult for you these three years.

130
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,400
I promised my brother. I would definitely protect you well.

131
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
I'll take you away from Shanghai to Yan'an.

132
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,300
We want to go, too, but we cannot go.

133
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,100
- We are people with missions.<br>- I know. I'm not afraid of death!

134
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,000
I know we have a mission. Before we kick out the Japanese,

135
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,300
we cannot live peacefully.

136
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,700
But these days have been too hard for me.

137
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,600
I live every day among the Japanese and Chinese traitors.

138
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,000
I cannot beat them or kill them, I can only laugh with them!

139
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Is this the way humans should live?

140
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,300
There's little time, let's talk about serious matters.

141
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,900
Is there any new situation happening at the Special Operations Division?

142
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,400
There were a lot of intelligence reports about Sparrow recently.

143
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,200
It's giving the Japanese a headache. They've given the Special Operations a deadline to catch him.

144
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,500
Do you know about a top secret military plan of the Japanese?

145
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
What's the code name?

146
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,500
According to the latest intelligence that our organization got,

147
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,800
The Reorganized National Government and the Japanese have built a secret base.

148
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,790
The special spy agents that were trained from this base

149
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,300
will then be ordered to infiltrate the communist and nationalist militaries.

150
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,000
They will try to infiltrate deeply and

151
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,300
aim to destroy our parties from within.

152
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Once their plan succeeds, it will cause a disastrous effect.

153
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,100
We still don't know the code name of this plan.

154
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,900
It must not have yet involved our operation division.

155
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,800
That's why I hope that you can find it soon.

156
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,000
This is a top secret plan of the Japanese army to destroy China.

157
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,500
You must grab hold of the plan's code name and details then report it to our party leaders.

158
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,520
Sister-in-Law, is Pi Pi doing well?

159
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,700
He's doing quite good. Don't worry.

160
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,400
Can I go see Pi Pi?

161
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Right now, Pi Pi is not by my side,

162
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,700
but he's in a very safe place.

163
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,400
It's just that you can't go see him.

164
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,300
So as not to let the enemy suspect you, to protect your identity.

165
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,300
This is the party's rules.

166
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,500
Then how do I contact you in the future?

167
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,200
There's a church on Doule Road

168
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,200
called Hongde Church. Beside it, there's a mailbox.

169
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
I know that place.

170
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Write on the letter: No. 79 Ningde Road, to Mr. Gan Daofu.

171
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,700
Your superior will then inform me about your news.

172
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,300
That person's code name is Doctor.

173
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
Is that mailbox safe?

174
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,800
Very safe. The mailman on that road belongs to our party.

175
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Chen Shen, from this day on,

176
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
your code number is 023.

177
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
I'll get going.

178
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,700
Sister-in-Law,

179
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,100
I'll leave first.

180
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,300
Be careful.

Hey, you guys, follow me closely later.

I'll drink. I'll drink. I'll drink.

189
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Xiaonan, what film are you shooting recently?

190
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,900
Recently,

191
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,800
<i>with some Director Zheng Zhengqiu and a lot more.</i>

192
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
<i>I'm currently choosing scripts</i>

193
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
<i>to see which role is more suitable for me.</i>

<i>If you really became a celebrity, don't forget us.</i>

195
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,300
- I will surely not forget you guys. I'll treat you guys to wine by then.<br>- You just had a few lines on your last movie and now there are already directors competing for you?

196
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,000
You really got famous quickly.

197
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,300
That's right. Soon, I'll already be a big celebrity.

198
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,700
Why were you gone for so long?

199
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
- Come. Let's play a game.<br>- I don't want to play.

200
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,900
Hey, Mister, Kvass, right?

201
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,600
Don't want to play and don't want to drink alcohol, how are you like a man?

202
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,100
Then how come you still like me?

203
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,600
I just like you.

204
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400

Stop! Don't run! Stop right there!

Stop right there!

229
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,000
It's as if you don't know. I frequently go off post.

230
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,300
You're becoming more and more unreasonable!

231
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,000
You want me to report it to Li Moqun like that, right?

232
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,500
You don't want this job anymore, is that right?

233
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,000
Just tell him that I came here first to lead the squad.

234
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Is she a communist or a nationalist?

235
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,700
- Come out!<br>- I only said one sentence.

252
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,500
All of you have already been registered in our records.

I didn't hear it clearly.

257
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,800
We heard you.

258
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,900
I can't drink this.

259
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,400
Why can't you drink it?

260
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
It's too unsophisticated.

261
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
So the sodas you drink are sophisticated?

262
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,800
Drinking them during winter makes your body shiver.

263
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
Stop pretending here.

264
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,200
If I don't pretend, how will the women like me?

265
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,400
Then why don't you find a serious one to introduce to me?

266
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Stop looking for bar girls or actresses, okay?

267
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Reporting to Division Chief, everyone has already been inspected.

268
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,100
We've caught 8 suspects.

269
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,800
Don't let anyone off.

270
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Don't worry, Division Chief. Everyone has already been put on record.

271
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Sorry, everyone. We have interfered with your time.

272
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,700
May everyone continue with what you were doing.

273
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Disband the team.

274
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,700
Take all of them back. Take them away.

275

Yeah, we're going.

277
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
- Move.<br>- I just went out to have fun and that's illegal?

278
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,800
Everyone tell me. Did I commit anything illegal?!

279
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,400
Did I break the law? Right?

280
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,900
Damn you! I'm going to tell you what law you broke.

293
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,300
I just came back from the hospital.

294

I'll first get you some water then I'll go buy your breakfast.

Yes. If she died, I would have returned earlier.

Where did that intelligence yesterday come from?

298
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,800
We caught a communist. After torturing him hard, he finally confessed.

299
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,300
Although that woman looked quite refined, she's quite high ranked within the communist organization.

300
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,400
She's called something like... Prime Minister.

301
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,600
That high? She's just one level lower than the emperor.

302
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Right?

303
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,000
That Sparrow that we were looking for is under her.

304
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Think about it, quite high-ranked, right?

305
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,900
High. Really high.

306
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,700
I'll first go get some water then I'll buy you breakfast.

307
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,400
Don't buy breakfast today.

308
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,500
After you're done getting water, go and make up some sleep.

309
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,800
Afterwards, go to the hospital to continue keeping watch.

The money is already with me. I surely have to buy you one.

312
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,000
When have I inquired about how you spend my money?

313
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,600
I also will be eating.

314
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,200
I'll buy one back for you. Okay?

315
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,000
That's not suitable. This...

316
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,400
It's settled already.

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,200
Then I... want to eat pan fried pork bun.

318
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,700
It was tiring for you to be on night duty.

319
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,100
Even if you don't say it, I'll buy you a pan fired pork bun.

320
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
Thank you, Boss.

321
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,900
I'll go get water now.

322
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Is this Fushou Cigarette Shop?

323
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,300
Hello.

324
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,700
All eight have already confessed?

325
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,500
Okay. I'll be there later to personally interrogate them.

326
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Wu Zhiguo!

327
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,700
- Hurry and get Chen Shen for me.<br>- Yes.

328
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,500
Jeez, Leader Chen, you're finally here.

329
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,100
Look how long my bangs are. It's blocking my eyes already. Cut them for me later.

330
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,400
No problem. To be able to serve a beautiful lady is exactly what I've been looking for.

331
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,300
I'll help you after I've eaten breakfast.

332
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,600
Leader Chen's tongue is really so sweet.

333
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,000
Say, which woman won't be enchanted to death by you?

334
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,800
Beautiful ladies only say it

335
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,900
but not one is willing to marry me.

336
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,700
Oh, right. I heard that you guys caught a lot of communists.

337
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,100
Your news is quite up-to-date.

338
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,000
Everyone already knew upon arriving this morning.

339
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,300
One communist is in the hospital while the other eight have already confessed.

340
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,300
That's right. Old Bi's headache will start now.

341
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Leader Chen, Division Chief asked you to go to him.

342
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,610
Oh, I got it.

343
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,890
I'll go see Old Bi first. I'll cut your hair afterwards.

344
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's cover it or else it would be cold later.

345
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,100
Is there a suspect that needs a haircut?

346
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,400
Other than knowing to cut hair and looking for girls, what else do you know to do?

347
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,800
Oh. Does gambling count?

348
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
Stop acting silly.

349
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
During usual days, it's fine but today we have serious matters to attend to.

350
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,400
Be a little serious. You're a team leader after all.

351
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Team Leader Chen.

352
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,100
Say it.

353
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,300
Just randomly pick one then just eliminate the other seven.

354
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,800
Done?

355
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,900
You watched for so long and you can only tell me this?

356
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,200
Do I need you to teach me that?

357
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,300
I have no way to look at it. Unless you want to investigate each of their backgrounds thoroughly.

358
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,000
Just talking to her makes them her communist comrades? I've even talked with her.

359
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,700
You even talked with her?

360
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,800
I even treated her to a soda.

361
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
She's quite pretty. Isn't she?

362
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,300
What did you say?

363
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,390
Miss, do you want a haircut?

364
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:02,400
Director Jiang should really be embarrassed to have an instructor like you for the Batch 16 of the Whampoa Military Academy.

365
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
That's why I don't brag around that I'm from Whampoa Military Academy.

366
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,100
I just tell them that I'm from the 66th Revolutionary Army

367
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,500
and was just a cook.

368
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,600
Get lost. Get lost.

369
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Let me say another thing. Okay?

370
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,700
Are you sure that woman is a communist?

371
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,600
The communist we caught beforehand, An Liusan, has already went to the hospital to take a look.

372
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,400
It's her.

373
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,100
Do you want to call Special Operations Team 2 to help?

374
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Go then.

375
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,700
At the hospital, once her situation even slightly improves,

376
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,000
bring her back here.

377
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,200
- I'm going now.<br>- Go then.

378
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Division Chief,

379
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,300
are you suspecting Team Leader Chen?

380
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Later, bring out that flat headed guy to me.

381
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
- I'm going to personally interrogate him.<br>- Yes.

382
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,800
Tell Wu Zhiguo to go to the hospital and keep watch of Chen Shen.

383
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
I understand.

384
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,200
Don't ever let Chen Shen and the suspect have any chance to interact with each other.

385
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Yes.

386
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
- Boss.<br>- Boss.

387
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,300
Team 1 will take care of the inside while Team 2 will handle the outside.

388
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
Yes, Team Leader Chen.

389
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,700
Let's go.

390
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
Come. Come. Come. Hurry and follow.

391
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,900
<i>[Wu Zhiguo: Special Operations Team 2, deputy team leader]</i>

392
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,600
Do you guys know what a big fish is? If a lured fish escapes,

393
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,400
- we will be killed.<br>- Yes, sir.

394
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,300
Guard closely.

395
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Boss.

396
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,600
How is it?

397
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,000
It's one steel tube. All the guards inside and outside are our men.

398
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,900
Other than the suspect, are there other patients here?

399
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,600
Last night, they transferred two patients inside.

400
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,200
They're both about to die. I've already informed the hospital about our situation.

401
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,700
Even families of the patients can't get in easily.

402
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,890
How many exits are there inside?

403
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,800
Just this one.

404
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,500
Then is the suspect awake already?

405
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,800
She's already awake. She's even more energetic than me.

406
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Hey, Old Bi said that as long as she's not dying, we're taking her back for interrogation.

407
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,000
That's great. Let's hurry and take her back.

408
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,700
Our men wouldn't even dare to close their eyes, afraid that we'll lose her.

409
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,700
- What room is the suspect in?<br>- 322.

410
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,900
322...

411
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,600
Bian Tou!

412
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,100
- What's the situation of the suspect?<br>- I've already reported it to Boss.

413
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,470
Oh, Team Leader Chen.

414
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,200
Team Leader Chen.

415
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,000
Let's go. Let's go to her room and see.

416
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,600
Doctor, how's the suspect's injuries?

417
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,800
The bullet penetrated through her right shoulder but it didn't injure the lungs.

418
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,700
She most likely isn't in any life-threatening danger.

419
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,000
Sterilization, hemostasis, and surgery for infection.

420
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,100
You have not done any of these yet?

421
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,900
Right. We must first sterilize the wound

422
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,600
and observe the situation.

423
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,400
We're still discussing about it.

424
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,190
Based on her current state,

425
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,800
if she can recuperate well, she'll be able to get out of bed very soon.

426
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,700
<i>Our operation headquarters also has a medical clinic.</i>

427
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,000
<i>Prescribe all the medicines that she'll need.</i>

428
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,100
<i>We will be taking the suspect back for interrogation.</i>

429
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,300
<i>This... What if her wounds get infected?</i>

430
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Team Leader Chen, Division Chief Bi has already given instructions that as long as the suspect is not dying,

431
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,200
then we must immediately take her back for interrogation.

432
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,300
Old Bi also said the same thing to me.

433
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,100
Then may I ask Team Leader Chen to call Division Chief Bi to clarify our next move?

434
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,000
Okay. Where's the phone?

435
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
- I have one in my office.<br>- Lead the way.

436
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,900
It's the clinic in the room across from here. Let's go.

437
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,000
<i>Is this Fushou Cigarette Shop? I'm looking for Pi Dan.</i>

438
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,900
<i>Brother Shen, here's the stuff that you asked for.</i>

439
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
<i>Just this much, will it work?</i>

440
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,400
<i>It's so effective. Be careful not to hurt yourself.</i>

441
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,600
<i>No one knows about this thing, right?</i>

442
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,000
<i>No one. How will anyone know?</i>

443
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,400
<i>I'll go now.</i>

444
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,600
Shen Zhaoqing,

445
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,000
you've already confessed to everything. Do you know that it's a crime punishable by death?

446
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,900
I know.

447
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
Think about if you still have anything you want to tell me

448
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,000
that might save your life.

449
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I really just told that woman one statement.

450
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,900
If talking is punishable by death,

451
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,300
that person earlier told her more than one sentence.

452
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,200
I really am innocent.

453
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,500
Did you hear what they were talking about?

454
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,100
I also didn't clearly hear it. I just remember that

455
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,300
he ordered a bottle of Kvass for that lady.

456
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,800
Reporting, Division Chief!

457
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,100
Team Leader Chen has called from the hospital.

458
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,300
<i>Hello.</i>

459
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,700
The bullet penetrated through soft tissues. It didn't injure the lungs.

460
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,000
She broke a rib and is still lying down here in the hospital.

461
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,700
Do you want to come over and take a look?

462
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,100
Okay. I'll go over there to take a look.

463
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,800
Hurry up.

464
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,700
Come in.

465
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,300
Division Chief, will you be continuing to interrogate that Shen Zhaoqing?

466
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,800
He came to Shanghai from Chongqing <i>(Nationalist headquarters)</i> last month, right?

467
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
Right. That's what he said.

468
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,400
- Send some men to investigate his background at Chongqing.<br>- Yes.

469
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,800
- Prepare the car. To Tongren Hospital.<br>- Yes.
